# Flight Management System

This repository contains a Java-based Flight Management System, designed to organize and prioritize flights efficiently. It includes classes for representing flights, a priority queue implementation for sorting them, and a main program demonstrating the system's functionality.

## Features

- **Flight Class**: Represents individual flights, including flight data and priority.
- **Priority Queue**: Implements custom sorting logic to prioritize flights based on defined criteria.
- **Main Program**: Demonstrates the usage of the Flight Management System by creating flights, assigning priorities, and sorting them accordingly.

## Getting Started

To run the Flight Management System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler.
3. Run the Main class to see the system in action.

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main

Usage

    Add new flights by creating instances of the Flight class with relevant data and priorities.
    Customize sorting criteria by modifying the Comparator in the SortQueue class.
    Explore and extend the functionality of the system as needed for your application.
